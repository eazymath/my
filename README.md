# Compound Interest Calculation Using the Ratio Method

The **Ratio Method** simplifies compound interest calculations by leveraging ratios for each compounding period. This method is particularly useful for common interest rates over standard time periods.

### Formula and Steps
For a rate \( r \% \) and a period of \( n \) years:
1. Start with an initial ratio of \( 1 + \frac{r}{100} \).
2. Multiply by this ratio for each year to obtain the compounded ratio.
3. Subtract 1 from the final compounded ratio to get the effective interest rate for the period.

### Example Calculation: 20% Interest for 3 Years
1. **First Year**:
   \[
   \text{Ratio after Year 1} = 1 + 0.20 = 1.2
   \]
2. **Second Year**:
   \[
   \text{Ratio after Year 2} = 1.2 \times 1.2 = 1.44
   \]
3. **Third Year**:
   \[
   \text{Ratio after Year 3} = 1.44 \times 1.2 = 1.728
   \]
4. **Effective Interest Rate**:
   \[
   \text{Effective CI Ratio} = 1.728 - 1 = 0.728 \text{ or } 72.8\%
   \]

Thus, the compound interest rate over 3 years at 20% is **72.8%**.
